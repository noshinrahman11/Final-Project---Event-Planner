This is an event planner website. After you sign up and log in, you can view your dashboard with your list of upcoming events. 
All events have a title, a date/time, and a description. 
All events that are in the past will not be shown. 
Two buttons at the top allow you to sort by name or by time. When initially listed, they are in the order of when they were created. 

There is a button on the dashboard that allows you to generate a list of upcoming events in New York City with the SerpAPI, which uses a Google Events search. 

I had to create an account to get an API key at https://serpapi.com/google-events-api

The requirements.txt file lists all dependencies.
